## Why i did this? 
I find myself **re-visit StackOverflow questions** I've already read. 
 
When there are **multiple answers** (and approaches to solve something), I upvote **my chosen answer** 
 
Some time later, i find myself **re-visit that question**. 
Since i want to spare that research i already did in the past, i try to **find the upvoted answers made by my user** (to get an acknowledge by myself).  
 
###Scrolling down? 
What bothers me in this process is the fact that answers **aren't always at the top** and i have to scroll down to the bottom to see them. 
 
**That's sucks.** Therefore i made this chrome extension that **re-sorts the answers** by your votes. For instance, if you upvoted an answer and revisited that question later, it will appear first in the answers list 
 
 
### Background 
I [suggested this feature](http://meta.stackexchange.com/q/278810/295552) on Meta StackExchange. **However**, upon this day i still waited and it seems this might not got the attention of their Product Manager. 
 
Since i see StackOverflow as an important tool in my daily routine, i implemented this chrome extension as a weekend project mainly to help myself and other developers be more productive :+1:.
